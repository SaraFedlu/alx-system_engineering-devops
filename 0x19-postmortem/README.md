#### Issue Summary

**Duration**: The WordPress outage lasted for a solid 2 hours, from 14:00 to 16:00 UTC on June 18, 2024.

**Impact**:  Imagine a world without WordPress for a moment. Yes, it happened, leaving 100% of our users staring at error messages instead of our beautiful content. Apache services were also on strike, refusing to cooperate.

**Root Cause**: A single typo in `wp-settings.php`—where "class-wp-locale.phpp" was mistakenly written instead of "class-wp-locale.php". This tiny mistake had a massive impact, breaking the site.

#### Timeline

- **14:00 UTC**: Our monitoring system flagged an issue—the WordPress site was down.
- **14:05 UTC**: An engineer confirmed the outage. The site was inaccessible.
- **14:10 UTC**: We began investigating recent changes to the server and WordPress.
- **14:20 UTC**: Apache logs spilled the beans—PHP errors were throwing shade at wp-settings.php, indicating where the problem might be.
- **14:30 UTC**: We initially suspected issues with Apache or MySQL, leading us down a few wrong paths.
- **14:45 UTC**: The incident was escalated to the senior DevOps team for deeper investigation.
- **15:00 UTC**: The team discovered the typo in `wp-settings.php` that caused the outage.
- **15:15 UTC**: We decided to fix the issue using Puppet automation.
- **15:30 UTC**: Puppet encountered a missing module (`puppetlabs-stdlib`), causing delays.
- **15:45 UTC**: We quickly switched to using a `sed` script to fix the typo.
- **16:00 UTC**: The fix was applied, Apache was restarted, and the WordPress site was back online.

#### Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause**: A simple typo in `wp-settings.php`—"class-wp-locale.phpp" instead of "class-wp-locale.php"—caused the site to crash. This tiny error in the file path prevented WordPress from loading properly.

**Resolution**: We fixed the typo using a `sed` script to replace the incorrect line. After applying the fix and restarting Apache, the WordPress site was back up and running.

#### Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes**:
- **Code Review Rigor**: Sharpen our typo-spotting skills to catch sneaky errors before they make it to production.
- **Puppet Module Management**: Keep a watchful eye on Puppet modules—ensure they're all pre-installed and behaving.

**Tasks**:
1. **Codebase Cleanup**: Review and fix similar typos across our codebase.
2. **Automation Enhancements**: Develop and deploy automated scripts to detect and fix common errors.
3. **Module Validation**: Validate and preload all essential Puppet modules to prevent future surprises.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Improve PHP error monitoring to catch issues more quickly.
5. **Training**: Host training marathons to boost our error-detecting prowess across teams.
6. **Documentation**: Update our incident response documentation with detailed steps for using Puppet and `sed` for fixes.

With these measures, we'll be better prepared to prevent similar issues in the future. Remember, even a tiny typo can cast a big shadow—stay vigilant and typo-free!

#### Lessons Learned: Typo Tyranny No More!

In this adventure, a single typo caused massive disruption, but with quick thinking and teamwork, we conquered the typo monster and restored peace to our WordPress kingdom!
