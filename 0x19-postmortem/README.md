### Issue Summary

**Duration**: The outage lasted for approximately 2 hours, from 14:00 to 16:00 UTC on June 18, 2024.

**Impact**: The WordPress site hosted on the server experienced a complete outage. Users were unable to access the website, resulting in 100% of users being affected. Additionally, Apache services were intermittently down during the troubleshooting process, exacerbating the accessibility issues.

**Root Cause**: A syntax error in the `wp-settings.php` file caused by a typo ("class-wp-locale.phpp" instead of "class-wp-locale.php") prevented the WordPress site from loading correctly.

### Timeline

- **14:00 UTC**: Issue detected by automated monitoring systems, which flagged the WordPress site as unresponsive.
- **14:05 UTC**: Incident confirmed by an on-call engineer who received the alert.
- **14:10 UTC**: Initial investigation began, focusing on recent changes to the server and WordPress installation.
- **14:20 UTC**: Apache logs were checked, revealing PHP errors pointing to the `wp-settings.php` file.
- **14:30 UTC**: Misleading investigation led to checking for potential issues with Apache and MySQL services.
- **14:45 UTC**: Issue escalated to the senior DevOps team for deeper investigation.
- **15:00 UTC**: Detailed code review of WordPress files identified the typo in `wp-settings.php`.
- **15:15 UTC**: Plan formulated to use Puppet for automated correction of the typo.
- **15:30 UTC**: Attempt to apply Puppet manifest failed due to missing `puppetlabs-stdlib` module.
- **15:45 UTC**: Revised Puppet manifest created to fix the typo without relying on `puppetlabs-stdlib`.
- **16:00 UTC**: Puppet manifest successfully applied, typo corrected, and Apache services restored. Website confirmed to be operational.

### Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause**: The issue was caused by a typo in the `wp-settings.php` file of the WordPress installation, specifically a misspelled include statement (`class-wp-locale.phpp` instead of `class-wp-locale.php`). This prevented the WordPress site from loading, leading to the outage.

**Resolution**: The resolution involved creating a Puppet manifest to automate the correction of the typo. Initially, attempts to use the `puppetlabs-stdlib` module failed due to syntax errors in the module. The issue was resolved by modifying the Puppet manifest to directly use `sed` to fix the typo and ensuring Apache was restarted to apply the changes.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes**:
- Enhance code review processes to catch typos before deployment.
- Ensure all necessary Puppet modules are pre-installed and validated.
- Improve monitoring to detect and diagnose PHP errors more quickly.

**Tasks**:
1. **Patch WordPress Code**: Manually review and correct any similar typos or errors in the current codebase.
2. **Automate Typo Detection**: Implement automated scripts to scan for common coding errors and typos.
3. **Validate Puppet Modules**: Ensure all required Puppet modules are installed and functional on all servers.
4. **Improve Logging and Monitoring**: Enhance logging for PHP errors and integrate with monitoring tools for faster detection and alerts.
5. **Conduct Training**: Provide additional training for developers and DevOps engineers on error detection and automated correction techniques.
6. **Review and Update Documentation**: Update internal documentation to reflect the new procedures for handling similar issues, including detailed steps for using Puppet to automate fixes.

By implementing these measures, we aim to reduce the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future and improve our response time and effectiveness when dealing with site outages.
