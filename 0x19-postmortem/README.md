**Issue Summary:**

**Duration:**  
Start Time: November 17, 2023, 08:00 AM (UTC)  
End Time: November 17, 2023, 12:00 PM (UTC)

**Impact:**  
The outage affected the availability of our primary user authentication service. During this period, users experienced login failures and delays, impacting approximately 30% of our user base.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an unintended disruption in the authentication flow.

**Timeline:**

- **08:00 AM (UTC):** Issue detected through a surge in error rates for user authentication.
  
- **08:15 AM (UTC):** Monitoring alerts triggered, signaling a potential service disruption.

- **08:30 AM (UTC):** Initial investigation focused on the authentication service logs, suspecting a database connectivity issue.

- **09:00 AM (UTC):** Misleading assumption led to database optimization efforts, but the issue persisted.

- **09:30 AM (UTC):** Incident escalated to the infrastructure team as the impact continued to grow.

- **10:00 AM (UTC):** Extensive investigation revealed the misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.

- **11:00 AM (UTC):** Load balancer settings corrected, and user authentication service restored.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

**Root Cause:**
The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused an unintended disruption in the authentication flow. Specifically, a change in the load balancing algorithm led to the rejection of valid authentication requests, causing the service degradation.

**Resolution:**
The issue was resolved by reverting the load balancer settings to their previous configuration. Additionally, thorough testing was conducted to ensure the restoration of normal service operations.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

**Improvements/Fixes:**
1. Implement stricter change control processes for critical infrastructure components.
2. Enhance monitoring for load balancer configurations to detect anomalies promptly.
3. Conduct regular training sessions for operations teams on the potential impact of load balancer changes.

**Tasks:**
1. **Rollback Load Balancer Configuration:**
   - Identify and document the changes made to the load balancer.
   - Revert the load balancer configuration to the state before the incident.

2. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Implement additional monitoring checks for load balancer configurations.
   - Set up automated alerts for any deviations from the standard configuration.

3. **Change Control Procedures:**
   - Review and refine the change control procedures related to critical infrastructure components.
   - Introduce mandatory peer reviews for changes that may impact core services.

By implementing these measures, we aim to minimize the risk of similar incidents in the future and ensure a more resilient authentication service for our users.
